1.Ethernet is a widely used LAN 
    //Coaxical cable
    10 base 2 -> 10mbps speed 200 meter
    10 base 5 -> 10mbps speed 500 meter
    //unshield twisted cable
    10 base T -> 10mbps speed 100m
    100 base T ->100mbps speed 100m
    //optical fiber cable
    100 base Fx -> 100mbps speed 2km
2.Twisted pair cable is a cable made by interjoining two separate insulated wires and running them parallel to each
    there are 2 type a.Unshield twested cable 
                     b.Shield twesetd cable

3.Category 5 cable(CAT5) is aslo TPcable for computer used for 100 Base T and 1000 base T.
    EIA/TIA 568A and EIA/TIA 568B termination standards define the pins to pair assignment in CAT5
4.Straight through cable is a type of TPC use in LAN to connect computer with router it is also called patch cable
     here either both end use 568A or 568B standard ,use to connect two different type device
5. it is use one end 568A and other end 568B wiring standard ,use to connect same type device

    {w/or,or,w/gr,bl,w/bl,gr,w/br,br}----->568B
    {w/gr,gr,w/or,bl,w/bl,or,w/br,br}----->568A
